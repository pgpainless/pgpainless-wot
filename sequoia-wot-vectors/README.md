# Sequoia-WOT Test Vectors

This module contains test vectors (PGP Keyring files) from [Sequoia-WOT](https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia-wot/-/tree/main/tests/data)
which are licensed under the [3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause/).

Kotlin wrappers have been added around the PGP files for easy access.

JUnit tests in `src/test/kotlin/org/pgpainless/wot/query/` are ported from Sequoia-WOT and are therefore licensed under the LGPL-v2.
